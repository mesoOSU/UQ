The directories contatined in this repository contain code for uncertainty quantification in materials models
using a random effects hierarchical Bayesian inferential framework.

VPSC_MCMC_no_discrepancy
---> UQ in the phenomenological VPSC model
---> Inference on unknown model parameters and features of the data generation process
---> Prediction for unobserved data
---> Sources of uncertainty accounted for: observation error, sample-to-sample experimental variance
---> Model misfit is not considered here

---> UQ in the phenomenological VPSC model
